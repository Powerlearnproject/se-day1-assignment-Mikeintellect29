Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, method, and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality software system.
IMPORTANCE
It enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of variuos life, communications,commerce.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1- Development of programming languages e.g C
2- The establishment pf software engineering as adiscipline in the 1960s.
3- The rise of agile methodeologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1- Requirement: deals with gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2- Design: creating high level and detailed designs of the software architrcture and user interface
3- Implementation: writing codes and building of the software according to the design specifications.
4- Deployment: releasing the software to users
5- Maintainance: providing ongoing, updates and enhancements to the software after deployement

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: they are appropriate for project where the scope, requirements, and designs, and outcome are in sequencial order.e.g. Medical Device Development.
Agile: suitable for project  that require flexibility, quick iterations and active stakeholder involvement. e.g. Startup Developing aNew Mobile App

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: ensure software quality by designing and execucting test plans
PROJECT MANAGER: Ooversees the planning , executions, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IMPORTANCE OF IDE
1- Code writing and editing: IDEs provides a rich set of tools for writing, editing, and managing codes.
2- Debugging: it allows developers to step through codes, inspect variables and set breakpoints, making it easier to identify and fix code fault.
EXAMPLES OF IDEs: Visual Studio Codes(VS Code), Eclipse.

IMPORTANCE OF VCS
1- Collaboration: it allows multiples developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each others changes.
2- Tracking Changes: it allows developers to track the history of changes.
EXAMPLES OF VCS: Git,Subversion



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
